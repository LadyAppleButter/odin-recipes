# Odin Recipes

Thursday 23 July 23

Start and finished this project today. Nothing to bad or difficult; decided to write my own recipes which took a little longer than necessary. 

Also, added an images folder to store the images used for the project. Included on each page are links to the other pages; it not a website without the ability to connect back and forth between pages.

 Need any assistances with linking images and folders on different levels vist W3Schools:
